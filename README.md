# Customized Bootloader for ARM Microcontrollers

This repository contains a customized bootloader designed for ARM microcontrollers, specifically targeting the Black Bill microcontroller. The bootloader facilitates firmware updates and system management via UART communication.

## Features
1-UART Communication: Enables communication between the microcontroller and external devices for firmware updates and system control.

2-Flash Memory Operations: Supports erasing and writing to flash memory for firmware updates.
-Command-based Protocol: Implements a command-based protocol for receiving instructions from the host device.

3-CRC Verification: Utilizes CRC verification to ensure data integrity during communication.

## Hardware Requirements
1-Microcontroller: Compatible with ARM-based microcontrollers, tested on the Black Bill microcontroller.

2-UART Interface: Requires UART communication for interfacing with external devices.

3-Host Device: A host device capable of sending commands and data to the bootloader via UART.

## Installation
1-Clone the repository to your development environment:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/KarimZidan007/Customized_Bootloader_for_BlackBill

```

## Building and Flashing
1-Build the bootloader using your preferred toolchain. Make sure to configure the build settings according to your microcontroller specifications.

2-Flash the compiled bootloader binary onto your microcontroller using your preferred flashing method.

## Communication Protocol

The bootloader follows a command-based protocol for communication with the host device. Refer to the (bootloader.c) file for detailed command descriptions and usage examples.
