Customized Bootloader for ARM Microcontrollers
This repository contains a customized bootloader designed for ARM microcontrollers, specifically targeting the Black Bill microcontroller. The bootloader facilitates firmware updates and system management via UART communication.

Features
UART Communication: Enables communication between the microcontroller and external devices for firmware updates and system control.
Flash Memory Operations: Supports erasing and writing to flash memory for firmware updates.
Command-based Protocol: Implements a command-based protocol for receiving instructions from the host device.
CRC Verification: Utilizes CRC verification to ensure data integrity during communication.
Usage
Hardware Requirements
Microcontroller: Compatible with ARM-based microcontrollers, tested on the Black Bill microcontroller.
UART Interface: Requires UART communication for interfacing with external devices.
Host Device: A host device capable of sending commands and data to the bootloader via UART.
Installation
Clone the repository to your development environment:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/custom-bootloader.git
Set up your development environment with the necessary toolchain and libraries for ARM microcontrollers.
Configure the bootloader according to your specific hardware and communication requirements.
Building and Flashing
Build the bootloader using your preferred toolchain. Make sure to configure the build settings according to your microcontroller specifications.
Flash the compiled bootloader binary onto your microcontroller using your preferred flashing method.
Communication Protocol
The bootloader follows a command-based protocol for communication with the host device. Refer to the bootloader.c file for detailed command descriptions and usage examples.
